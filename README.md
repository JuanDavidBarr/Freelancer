# Freelance's portfolio simulation

This is a small simulation of a web-page from **bootstrap's** web site. The idea was to implement bootstrap's set of classes to get familiar with them and learn how to use this powerful tool along with insights we already know from **HTML** and **CSS**

## Built with

The following technologies were used in the developpment of this project:

- [![Bootstrap](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bootstrap-7952B3?style=flat&logo=bootstrap&logoColor=white)](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS-563d7c?&style=flat&logo=css3&logoColor=white)](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)
- [![HTML](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-E34F26?style=flat&logo=html5&logoColor=white)](https://html.com/)

## Getting Started

You can integrate **Bootstrap 5** to your **HTML** by including the following tags:

- First, you must include the tag ``<link>`` in the ``<head>`` of your ``html`` index.
```http
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.6/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"
integrity="sha384-4Q6Gf2aSP4eDXB8Miphtr37CMZZQ5oXLH2yaXMJ2w8e2ZtHTl7GptT4jmndRuHDT" crossorigin="anonymous">
````
- Second, you musyt include the tag ``<script>`` inside the ``<body>`` tag.
```http
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.6/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
integrity="sha384-j1CDi7MgGQ12Z7Qab0qlWQ/Qqz24Gc6BM0thvEMVjHnfYGF0rmFCozFSxQBxwHKO"
crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
- Finally, you can read the introduction guide in the **[Bootstrap's](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)** where you can find further information.
